# ESP32-CAM-Face-Recognition-Door-Lock-System
ESP32-CAM Face Recognition Door Lock System
This project is a smart door lock system built using the ESP32-CAM module, enabling contactless access through real-time face recognition. It uses Haar Cascade detection and onboard face matching to identify authorized users. Upon successful recognition, a servo motor is triggered to unlock the door.

The entire system runs locally on the ESP32â€”no external server or cloud required. A built-in web interface over Wi-Fi allows live video streaming, user registration, and remote access control.

Key Features:

ESP32-CAM with OV2640 camera

On-device face recognition

Wi-Fi-based web UI

Servo-controlled door lock

Real-time video feed and registration

This project demonstrates low-cost, privacy-conscious embedded vision and IoT integration for smart home security applications.
